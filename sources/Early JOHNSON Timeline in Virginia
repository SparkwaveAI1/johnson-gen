Early JOHNSON Timeline in Virginia
This database is an extraction of every reference to Johnson / Johnston in the Virginia land grants / patents based on the series of published abstracts. To make the total manageable, I’ve reduced the entries to the barest minimum while still providing enough information to identify same named individuals from clusters of neighbors or geographic features. By using the key below, one can easily locate the original abstract or better yet, the entire patent is available from the Virginia Library’s website: http://www.lva.lib.va.us/dlp/index.htm Throughout the database I’ve added ‘See patent’ notes which refer back to the original patent OR to another patent which MAY offer a clue in identifying one family group / individual. These latter notes should be taken as clues only. Linda Sparks Starr July 2002
