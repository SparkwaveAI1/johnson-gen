# Johnsons and Johnstons: Migration Corridors of Colonial Virginia

## Project Overview

A comprehensive book organizing and refining decades of Johnson/Johnston family research, primarily from the work of Tony L. Johnson and associated researchers. The goal is to transform voluminous genealogical research into a usable reference for researchers and a compelling narrative for general readers.

**Core Focus**: Tracing Johnson/Johnston families through the major migration corridors from colonial origins through westward expansion. The geographic scope follows the families themselves - from northern origins (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland) through Virginia's Tidewater, Piedmont, and Valley regions, then into North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, and beyond.

**Time Period**: Primarily 1650-1830, covering the colonial period through early Republic.

## Project Goals

1. **Organize** - Structure Tony's extensive research into navigable, logical groupings
2. **Verify** - Distinguish between well-founded conclusions, reasonable theories, and speculation
3. **Connect** - Map relationships between Johnson lines and allied families
4. **Narrate** - Tell the story of these families in a compelling way
5. **Publish** - Create a useful book for researchers that can generate revenue for Tony

## The Source Material Challenge

### Tony's Research Files
Tony has created research files for:
- **Every county he's researched** (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky)
- **Individual family units** with deep dives on specific lines
- **Allied family compilations** (Looney-Renfro-Johnson, etc.)

**Important characteristics:**
- Material appears in **multiple files** - the same record may be in a county file, a family file, and a compiled file
- Material is **repeated within files** - Tony's chronological approach means the same person appears at multiple dates
- Files are **chronologically organized** by year (#1700, #1701, etc.)
- **Color-coded** by research thread: DNA groups, specific researchers, known vs. speculative
- **Raw compilation**: Primary source transcriptions mixed with analysis, speculation, and researcher notes

**Scale**: The three sample files alone contain 100,000+ lines. The full collection is orders of magnitude larger.

**The task**: Extract signal from noise - identify solid conclusions, map verified relationships, eliminate redundancy, and structure into something usable.

## Primary Sources

### Tony L. Johnson Research Collection
Files organized by county and family groupings. Currently inventoried:
- Va-1692-Looney-Renfro-Johnson-Repaired.docx (18MB)
- Va-1719-Spotsylvania.docx (475KB)  
- Va-1738-Augusta.docx (21KB)
- *[Additional county and family files to be added]*

### Johnson/Johnston DNA Project
The J/J/J DNA Project provides genetic evidence for grouping related lines. Key DNA groupings referenced in Tony's research:

| Group Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **White Oak** | Michael Johnson d. 1718 Henrico Co VA - Haplogroup I |
| **Longleaf Pine** | Haplogroup J group within J/J/J Project |
| **Timothy Rich Line** | DNA matches to LTC Nathaniel Johnson and Mary Holland's Hiram Johnson |
| *[Additional groups TBD]* | |

DNA evidence helps confirm or refute paper trail connections, but must be used carefully due to: non-paternity events, adoptions, name changes, and enslaved/orphaned individuals taking family names.

### Primary Source Types (to be gathered)
- Court records and order books
- Land grants and patents
- Wills and probate records
- Marriage bonds and registers
- Tax lists and tithables
- Military records (militia musters, Revolutionary War, pensions)
- Church records (vestry books, Quaker meeting minutes)
- Headright and transportation records

## Research Groups (Tony's Color Coding)

When working with Tony's original .docx files, color indicates research threads:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Fuschia** | Tony L. Johnson, Peggy Johnson, Lee Johnson's relations (Burton, Farmer, Carter, Dale, Lound, Haile, Hatcher) |
| **Blue** | Clues to Hudson Johnson (known White Oak descendant) |
| **Green** | Group White Oak - Michael Johnson d. 1718 Henrico Co VA, DNA Haplogroup I |
| **Purple** | Cousin Joe Matlock's research |
| **Highlighted** | DNA matches to Timothy Rich line |
| **Teal** | Quaker dates (require Julian calendar conversion pre-1752) |
| **Red** | County/Parish line changes affecting jurisdiction |

*Note: Color coding is lost when converting to plain text. Reference original files for research attribution.*

## Geographic Migration Patterns

The Johnson/Johnston families followed established migration corridors. Understanding these patterns is key to tracing families and predicting where records may be found.

### Northern Origins
Many Johnson/Johnston families entered Virginia from the north:
- **Pennsylvania** - Philadelphia area, Lancaster County, the Quaker settlements
- **New Jersey** - West Jersey Quaker communities
- **Maryland** - Frederick County, the Eastern Shore
- **Further north** - New York, New England (some lines)

### The Virginia Corridor

**1. Tidewater (1607-1720s)**
- First settlement: James City, Henrico, Charles City Counties
- Eastern Shore presence
- Movement up the major rivers (James, York, Rappahannock)

**2. Piedmont Expansion (1720s-1760s)**
- Spotsylvania County (formed 1721) - major staging area
- Orange County and its derivatives
- Louisa, Fluvanna, Albemarle Counties
- Following the fall line westward

**3. Valley Push (1740s-1770s)**
- Augusta County (formed 1738) - the great funnel
- Botetourt, Rockbridge Counties
- The Great Wagon Road corridor
- Connections to Pennsylvania German and Scots-Irish streams

**4. Southwest Frontier (1770s-1800)**
- Washington County, VA
- The Holston settlements (Sullivan, Hawkins Counties, TN)
- Movement through Cumberland Gap

### Destinations Beyond Virginia

**North Carolina**
- Granville District and northern Piedmont
- Yadkin River settlements
- Connection to Regulator movement

**Tennessee**
- Holston River settlements → East Tennessee
- Cumberland settlements → Middle Tennessee (Nashville)
- Movement into West Tennessee

**Kentucky**
- Through Cumberland Gap
- Bluegrass region (Lincoln, Madison, Fayette, etc.)
- Green River country

**Further West**
- Missouri (Ozarks)
- Following the frontier
